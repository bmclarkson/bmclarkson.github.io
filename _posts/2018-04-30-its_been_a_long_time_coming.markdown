**Me:** I'm a "successful" Marketing Manager for a company with a great culture, great employees and an enjoyable atmosphere to work within.  I should be happy and content, everything's peachy!

**Also me:** "If I don't get out of this rat race, I'm going to lose my mind."  

I've often felt like I'm wearing a mask, one that doesn't quite fit and that I keep trying to readjust for fear that one of my co-workers will find out that I'm not really cut out for this work, that I'm a fraud just trying to keep it all together.  So how'd I end up here?  

> "You need to get a college degree, otherwise you'll end up picking up trash for a living."

My mom (a good, honest person), believed that I needed a strong amount of direction and gudience for fear that I'd end up doing something a bit menial in comparison with what she thought I was capable of doing.  It's easy to look back at that statement as out of touch but at the time, it made sense and there was a truth to it.  "You're off to college, kid!"

I started out my schooling search with a visit from a recruiter at the Art Institute of Atlanta (AIA) preaching the gospel of design to a bunch of kids in Journalism/Newspaper class.  The idea was simple, I could go to school to design things via computer and my designs would be applied to many different multimedia landscapes.  I instantly fell in love with the premise.  While not a great artist (in the classical sense, I can't draw anything other than stick figures), the recruiter and subsequent other folks at AIA suggested that if I could "suffer through a couple of drawing classes," I'd be free to continue my design studies.  I enrolled and started promptly the summer (yes, SUMMER!) after graduating high school.  AIA here I come!

... as it'd turn out... it wasn't that simple.  Those drawing classes that I had to suffer through?  More than 5 and I was only three deep, sucking wind.   My professor kindly told me that I needed to seek other plans as this wasn't working.

I had to withdraw from AIA, realizing that my dreams of graphic design were pointless and I was getting older by the minute.  If I couldn't figure out what I was going to do and panic was starting to set in.  In the back of my mind, I heard that time-worn phrase reminding me that if I didn't get a college education, I'd end up making french fries for a living.  With my dream of graphic design tucked away deep down inside me, I embarked on an education in "Business Administration."  

I'll spare you the boring details of what took place between schooling for my generic degree and about a year ago (aka current me).  It was about a year ago that I realized I needed to do something more with my work life.  I never felt fully satisfied with my decision to quit my dream and while clearly I wasn't cut out for that program, I knew there was something more that I wanted to do.  Subconciously I must have realized this as I had spent the past 6 years fulfilling my time outside of work with hobbies like:
* making soap
* making small batch handheld pies
* making various small crafts in my garage

It became obvious that I loved creating... stuff.  It was an outlet to beat the 9 to 5 dreg and I wanted more of it.  While my soaps smelled nice, my pies tasted good and my washers sets (it's a midwestern thing) were killer, it wasn't anything I could make a career out of.  So queue that "about a year ago" phrase from earlier, I found myself digging... and digging... and digging more to find out what piqued my interest.  Through a couple of free bootcamp prep courses and a reminder of my software dev. friends in a previous career of mine did, I realize that coding brought me that same sense of happiness that my crafts did. * I could make things, with my own two hands, for others to enjoy AND get paid doing it!*  

While I had no doubt that if I had an ounce of artist talent my left hand, I would have made a great graphic designer.  I don't regret anything about the way my life decisions have played out.  Would it have been great to see that youthful dream come true?  Sure.  Do I regret it?  No way at all.  I'm thrilled with where I am, looking forward to seeing where I'll go.
